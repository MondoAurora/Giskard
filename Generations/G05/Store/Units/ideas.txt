===== IDEAS ======

SRC GEN
 - relative to the host unit (MiND, BrainJava)
 - move the local ID into the enum
 - move translation to the bottom (accept enum param as handle)
 
 -> text persistence?

create static data access 
 -> use in Montru activities
   -> text services?
   
===== NEXT ======

prepare for source generation

===== BOILING ======



===== TEMPORAL ======

write separate resource units for "en" content
auth, unit proxies in the language
vocabulary mapping (proxy to lang?)

===== SETTLED ======

write unit JSONs with IDs

verify id management
Set UnitID, nextID

replace ID SEP from '.' to '_'

===== POSTPONED ======

ID-based loader (validate only, needs src generation)

===== DROPPED ======
