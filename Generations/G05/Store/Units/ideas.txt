===== TODO ======

SRC GEN
 - relative to the host unit (MiND, BrainJava)
 - move the local ID into the enum
 - move translation to the bottom (accept enum param as handle)
 
 -> text persistence?

create static data access 
 -> use in Montru activities
   -> text services?
   
===== INCOMING ======

remove token from MiND -> provided by the actual brain, mentioned in the header
text - encoding tags
generic - HW data type tags, matrix, "matcher"
stream - use text/generic tags

abnf - unit with separate semantic net / token map units

JSON parser logic
 -> create it in DustBrain, instantiate
 -> header reference, unit creation (should work fine after bootstrap)
 -> content reading into set/insert commands
 -> acceptor to execute or store
 -> end / executor to do the delayed commands
 
===== NEXT ======

prepare for source generation

===== BOILING ======



===== TEMPORAL ======

write separate resource units for "en" content
auth, unit proxies in the language
vocabulary mapping (proxy to lang?)

===== SETTLED ======

write unit JSONs with IDs

verify id management
Set UnitID, nextID

replace ID SEP from '.' to '_'

===== POSTPONED ======

ID-based loader (validate only, needs src generation)

===== DROPPED ======
