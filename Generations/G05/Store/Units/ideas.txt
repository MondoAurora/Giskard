replace ID SEP from '.' to '_'

On load, set UnitID, nextID
 -> write unit JSONs with IDs, replace?
 -> write separate resource units for "en" content
   -> text persistence?
 -> move code away from using names internally, use IDs instead

create static data access 
 -> use in Montru activities
   -> text services?
