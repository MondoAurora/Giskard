Brain dump

Lazy creation
 - special default value on get?
 - flag on the member definition, so Get will always return a real entity, created on first call
 
the root block is the "runtime entity", so there is no shared machine, it's just a normal link/one member of the runtime, containing itself?

Cornerstones - must be separate, focused. SRP DSL dimensions, Tensegrity axes
 - Model - unit, entity, value, collection, link.
  === DATA memory segment
 - Idea - type, member, tag, service; tags for ValType, CollType.
  === META: Offsets in DATA/CODE segment: data members, function addresses
