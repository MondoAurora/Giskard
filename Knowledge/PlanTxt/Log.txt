 - I will not be able to hold all components in my mind, so from now on, I am not the centre that pulls the strings
 - I set up the posts and connect them with strings as they must be connected, their rules
 - I put rods to the edges and connect them at the centre
 - rods should not fit, that is elevation in the centre, and I should climb on the rods
 - the weirdness of this point is that now I give up source code as my comfort zone

  - NO, and this is the point: I can lose my brain (the running system), but not the mind, which is the specification
  - with proper backup and rollback mechanisms, it can be as safe as any other system
 
 - accept that the generated sources are the link, the token name is what I understand, but the ID is DB entity id. Not for human eyes.
 - create a DB view to_string that connects the string id to the entity (may join on load and use in db view)
